                <p>community
noun</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.
‘Montreal’s Italian community’
‘the gay community in London’
‘the scientific community’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mass noun The condition of sharing or having certain attitudes and interests in common.
‘the sense of community that organized religion can provide’</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We all know what a community means and what it means to be a part of it. If a person came up to you and asked if you belong to a certain community and who are the other people in that community, you can almost immediately answer the question with a list of names, perhaps incomplete, but almost always right. A kid will immediately list out his/her best friends and the community (s)he belongs to in school. We all know, intuitively, what a community means. But how do we translate this mathematically?</p>

<p>All of the above example only described communities in a social setting - a social network. But isn’t it also possible to find communities in the animal kingdom, telephone network, the world wide web, your anatomy, etc? We struggle a bit, but we can soon see how the idea of a community can be extended to different networks, but what does it mean, mathematically, for a set of entities to be a part of a community?</p>

<p>There have been a number of studies on how to define a community, find how many communities are present in a network and also how to segregate them. But there is still no consensus on a single or a set of frameworks that would work for different networks.</p>

<p>One of the first paper on community detection methods that I read was the Modularity and Community Structure in Network. The central idea of the paper was that if there are more than expected edges within a module (community) or equivalently, if there are less than expected edges between modules, we can conclude the current segregation is the most optimal method of dividing the network into communities. This is done by maximizing the modularity of the network given by Q = 1/4m <em>insert formula</em>.  where …..</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at what the formula represents. The term within the summation is only taken into account when the two nodes i and j belong to the same community. The term is rewarding (towards modularity) when two nodes of relatively low degrees that belong to the same module are directly connected and the least contribution to modularity when two nodes of very high degrees are directly connected within the module since it is not a very surprising possibility. There doesn’t seem to a big difference between nodes that are directly connected and those that aren’t. Let’s consider a network of total edges 100 and see how the different node pairs contribute to the modularity value.</p>

<p><em>insert image</em></p>

<p>As we can see there is little difference in the modularity contribution between nodes that are directly connected and those that aren’t. If there are two nodes with a very high degree compared to the other nodes, then they are likely in different communities and they will take along with them the nodes they are directly connected to. We can see it as two rich hubs that have communities of their own. (?)</p>

<p>Skipping the theory behind how this algorithm came to be from the formula above, the method of dividing the network into 2 communities is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the Modularity matrix B = A - kkT/2m</li>
  <li>Compute the eigen value and eigen vector of the modularity matrix B.</li>
  <li>The eigen vector corresponding to the highest eigen value represents the communities of the network. All positive values of the vector correspond to one community and the negative values correspond to a different community. If all the positions of this eigen vector have the same sign then they cannot be divided into any communities.</li>
</ol>

<p>To divide the network into more than two communities or see if it is possible, the same method as above is applied to the different community subgraphs. However there is a small change.</p>
