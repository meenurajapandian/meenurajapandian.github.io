We all know what a community means and what it means to be a part of it. If a person came up to you and asked if you belong to a certain community and who are the other people in that community, you can almost immidiately answer the question with a list of names, perhaps incomplete, but almost always right. A kid will immediately list out his/her best friends and the community (s)he belongs to school. We all know, intuitively, what a community means. But how do we translate this mathematically?

All of the above example only described communities in a social setting - a social network. But isn't it also possible to find communities in the animal kingdom, telephone network, the world wide web, your anatomy, etc? We struggle a bit, but we can definitely see how the idea of a community can be extended to different networks, but what does it really mean for a set of entities to be a part of a community?

There have been a number of studies on how to define a community, find how many communities are present in a network and also how to segregate them. But there is still no consesnsus on a single or a set of frameworks that would work for different networks.
